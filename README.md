# Utilities

This is a python package containing files used in my thesis. Most codes are based the nutils framework. For more information on nutils visit www.nutils.org.
This package contains:

* plotter.py - used for plotting solutions.
* writer.py - used for saving and interpreting data. 

Python packages needed:

* pygame 	(for anouncer.py) (remove import print in __init__ @ ~/.local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/pygame)
* matplotlib 	(for plotter.py)
* tkinter	(apt-get install python3-tk)
* mpltools	(plotting tools necessary for annotation)
